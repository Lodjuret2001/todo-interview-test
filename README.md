TODO APP:

I asked my nephew to set up a todo app for me, so that I can keep track of all the things going on in my life. He did an okay job, the application runs - yay.

My nephew however is a junior developer, and he's made a couple of blunders when writing his code. Can you please help me fix them?

A user should be able to:

- Write a title for a todo and create it
- Check a todo
- Uncheck a todo
- Delete a todo

Your job is to:

- Fix the errors in the code
- Make the code prettier
- Verbally communicate your thoughts and ideas as you're going through the code (what are you thinking about, the good, the bad and the ugly)

Please ask any questions that may arise.
Thank you for your help!
